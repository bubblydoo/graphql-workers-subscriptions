/**
 * Create a subscription handler for usage in the GraphQL schema.
 * 
 * This function implementation is confusing, but it is needed for the GraphQL schema to allow it.
 * It creates an async generator function that will never be executed, but
 * the GraphQL schema only accepts async generator functions for subscriptions.
 * It is never executed because we intercept the websocket connections in `handleSubscriptions` and
 * apply our own logic to parse the incoming subscription request.
 * We merely use this function to store the settings that the user defined in the schema (topic and filter).
 * We can then later use `fn.topic` and `fn.filter` in `handleSubscriptions`
